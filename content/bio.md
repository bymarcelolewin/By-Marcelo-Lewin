# About Marcelo

As a Vibe Coder and Product Creator, I enjoy building with AI and modern development tools. I specialize in MVPs, proof-of-concepts, and small experiments. I like exploring early ideas, iterating as I go, and using those prototypes to test whether a concept holds up before moving on to detailed planning.

I build all kinds of digital products—from CLI tools and web apps to games and utilities—always with an eye toward real-world impact.

## Startups Created and Sold

Throughout my career, I've founded and successfully exited several ventures, each teaching me valuable lessons about product development, market fit, and scaling businesses.
